The overall trend in hotel revenue indicates that City hotels consistently generate higher revenue than Resort hotels throughout the year. However, there is an exception during the third quarter, where the revenue of Resort hotels increases and surpasses that of City hotels.

Based on the overall parking percentage, it is evident that the utilization of the parking lot is merely 2.36%. This indicates that there is no immediate need to expand the parking lot size since the existing parking capacity is more than sufficient to accommodate the current demand.
